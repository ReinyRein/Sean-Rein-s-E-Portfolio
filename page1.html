        <h2>Quarter 1 ICT 9 Lessons</h2>
        <p>During the first quarter of ICT 9, students are introduced to fundamental HTML elements that help create well-structured web pages. These include lists, tables, forms, and hyperlinks.</p>
        
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>Lists in HTML allow for the organized display of information. There are two main types of lists: ordered lists (`&lt;ol&gt;`), which use numbers, and unordered lists (`&lt;ul&gt;`), which use bullet points. Lists are useful for creating navigation menus, to-do lists, and structured content.</p>
        
        <h3>Tables</h3>
        <p>Tables (`&lt;table&gt;` tag) organize data into rows (`&lt;tr&gt;`) and columns (`&lt;td&gt;`). They are essential for displaying structured information, such as schedules, pricing tables, or comparisons. The `<th>` tag is used to define header cells, making tables more readable.</p>
        
        <h3>Forms</h3>
        <p>Forms (`&lt;form&gt;` tag) allow user input by providing elements like text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, and submit buttons. Forms are crucial for login pages, surveys, and contact forms, enabling interactive and dynamic web pages.</p>
        
        <h3>Hyperlinks</h3>
        <p>Hyperlinks (`&lt;a&gt;` tag) connect different web pages, allowing users to navigate the internet seamlessly. They can open new pages, link to external websites, or jump to specific sections within a page. Hyperlinks are a fundamental aspect of web browsing and site connectivity.</p>

    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    In the first quarter of ICT 9, I learned fundamental principles of web development that were central to building properly structured and interactive web pages. The key areas of primary focus were HTML Lists, Tables, Forms, and Hyperlinks, all of which are essential in the effective organization and presentation of information.

    Grasping how to use lists—ordered or not—has helped me to put content in order. Knowing how to use tables has helped me to display information in an organized fashion, something very useful when organizing information such as timetables or data. The best experience was using forms, which allow user input through input fields, checkboxes, and buttons. Additionally, hyperlinks showed me how web pages link to one another, hence making it easy to move from one section to another and to other websites.

    The hardest part of it for me was the correct formatting of tables and how to make them responsive on various screen sizes. But as I practiced, I could understand the importance of using the right HTML attributes and nesting the elements in the right manner.

The training done this quarter has given me a good understanding of web development, and I look forward to the chance of combining CSS and JavaScript to enhance both the looks and functionality of my web pages.
